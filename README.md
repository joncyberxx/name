# John’s Ethical Hacking Learning Lab
 **Purpose:**  
This repository is a learning playground for ethical cybersecurity: lab setup instructions, safe exercises, and defensive/educational scripts. **All activities must be performed on systems you own or explicitly have permission to test.**
 > --
 **Important:** Never use tools or techniques from this repository to attack systems without explicit authorization. Illegal activity is strictly prohibited.
 ## Structure- `README.md` — this file  - `scripts/` — safe, educational scripts (password checker, simulated log monitor)  - `lab/` — instructions to set up a local VM lab (Kali, Metasploitable or intentionally vulnerable apps)  - `resources.md` — links to learning platforms, books, and CTFs  - `LICENSE` — suggested open-source license (MIT)--
## Quick start — Local learning lab (recommended)
 1. Install virtualization: VirtualBox or VMware.
 2. Create two VMs:
   - **Attacker VM**: Kali Linux (for learning tools).
   - **Target VM**: Metasploitable 2 / OWASP Juice Shop / DVWA (intentionally vulnerable).
 3. Network: Use Host-only or Internal Network so the lab is isolated from the internet.
 4. Follow safe practices: snapshots before exercises; disconnect host from sensitive networks.--
## Safe scripts (in `scripts/`)
 This repo includes only **educational / defensive** scripts:- `password_strength_checker.py` — checks password strength locally.- `simulated_log_monitor.py` — example of scanning a log file for suspicious patterns (works on sample logs only).
 These illustrate programming concepts useful in security work (parsing logs, hashing, validation), not exploits.--
## Learning path & resources- Beginner: Python for security, Linux basics, networking (TCP/IP), Bash scripting.  - Intermediate: Web app security (OWASP Top 10), SQLi/XSS basics in lab, basic reverse engineering.  - Advanced: Binary exploitation (in controlled CTFs), threat modeling, defensive engineering.
 Recommended platforms:- TryHackMe (labs and guided paths)  - Hack The Box (practical CTFs)  - OWASP Juice Shop (web security playground)  - CTFtime (CTF events and challenges)
 Books:- *The Web Application Hacker's Handbook* — for web security concepts  - *Practical Malware Analysis* — (study defensively; do not misuse)--
